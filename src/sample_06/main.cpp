/**

This sample shows how to create a minimal "engine" using phobos components. The engine will be able to only create a windows and answer to input commands.

For any rendering, implement your own render system inside the render class.

The game logic system will be fully working, just add modules as needed (pluginmanager, dictionarymanager, gameengine, etc)

For running the sample:
	* Make sure your IDE is pointing to the "work/sample06" as working directory, so the sample can read the "autoexec.cfg"
	* Configure your IDE to allow the program to find the dlls on bin/

For Visual Studio users, go to the project Property Pages, on the "Debugging" page, sets:
	* Working directory: ..\..\..\work\sample06
	* Environment: PATH=$(PHOBOS_DEPS_HOME)\bin

	* Note that "$(PHOBOS_DEPS_HOME)" is assumed to be pointing to PHOBOS DEPS build (https://github.com/bcsanches/phobos_deps)
